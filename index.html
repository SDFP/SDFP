  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>This is a group for anyone interested in Functional Programming. All levels of ability and experience are welcome. We meet monthly and together we'll figure out how to rewire our brains to think and code functionally.</p>
  <p>Our meetings generally begin with a programming challenge. You are encouraged to solve the problem in any language, ideally in collaboration with other attendees. After a break we encourage members to share & discuss their solutions with the group so we can see how different languages solve problems.</p>
  <p>From time to time we change things up and include a talk or two related to functional programming.</p>
